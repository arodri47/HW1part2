		<h1>This is Nonsense. Woo!</h1>
			
		<p>
		
		This is also a bunch of nonsense, but in a way it is good nonsense. Also, I cannot believe that this school has not replaced the useless seats
		that are bolted to the ground. Even the seats are connected to the ground. These seats make it very hard for people to go to the bathroom, because
		then everyone has to scooch in and not every American can spare a couple of inches to scooch in, especially with my chunky belly. This is a real 
		problem for me because I am trying to stay very hydrated. Actually, I have to go right now but, but I am stuck in this desk of doom!

		<h2>Immanual Kant</h2>
		
		<p>
		
		If you are ever wondering where to start on philosophy, start with Kant. He rules, and also he explains his thoughts in ways you could not imagine.
		The most interesting thing I have ever read on Kant was his belief in God by looking at biology. Every plant and animal was born with instinct; for 
		example, plants and crops open up towards the sun. Of course this can be refuted, but I find it interesting because I love to argue.
